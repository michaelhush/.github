## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork and clone the repository
1. Configure and install any dependencies
1. Make sure the tests pass on your machine
1. Create a new branch
1. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass
1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request
1. Pat yourself on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and
   merged

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull
request being accepted:

- Follow our [Coding Standards](#coding-standards)
- Spell variable names out in full using American English spelling (e.g.
  `optimized_pulse`, **NOT** `op`)
- For variable names that are more than three words, use an acronym (e.g.
  `cpmg`, **NOT** `carr_purcell_meiboom_gill`)
- Write tests and make sure they **all** pass (e.g. `pytest`)
- Lint your code using the file supplied in the project (e.g. `pylint
  directoryname --rcfile=.pylintrc`)
- Keep your change as focused as possible - if there are multiple changes you
  would like to make that are not dependent upon each other - submit them as
  separate pull requests
- Write a [good commit
  message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)

Note that we prefer squash merges from short-lived branches (e.g.
`feature/ABC-123`) to long-lived branches (e.g. `master`). If a project has both
`development` and `master` branches, we prefer the default merge commit option
for merges between them.

When squashing commits, lines that add little meaning to the overall commit
message (e.g. "Oops missed another instance") should be removed.
